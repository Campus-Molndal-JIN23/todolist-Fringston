# Project: To do list

## Description

- What was your motivation?

My motivation was to create a to do list that would allow me to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when I was done.
I also wanted to do a project with a MongoDB database.

- Why did you build this project?

I built this project to help people keep track of their tasks and also to practice TDD, MongoDB, Mockito, and GitHub CI.

- What problem does it solve?

This project solves the problem of forgetting to do tasks. It has a database that stores the tasks so that they can be accessed later.
The program can manage CRUD operations on the database.

- What did you learn?

I learned that a seemingly simple project can be very difficult to implement. 
I also learned how GitHub CI works and how to use Mockito with MongoDB.

## Installation

- Download MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. 
Follow the instructions and install MongoDB on your computer.
- Clone the project from GitHub.
- Open in IntelliJ or your preferred IDE.
- Run the project.
- Follow the instructions in the console to use the application.

## Usage

The application is used through the console.
When the application is run, the user is presented with a menu with the following options:

The user then uses the number keys to select an option and continues to follow the instructions in the console.
