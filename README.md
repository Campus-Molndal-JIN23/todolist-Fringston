# Project: To do list

## Description

- What was your motivation?

My motivation was to create a to do list that would allow me to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when I was done.
I also wanted to do a project with a MongoDB database.
- Why did you build this project?

I built this project to help people keep track of their tasks.

- What problem does it solve?

This project solves the problem of forgetting to do tasks.

- What did you learn?

I learned that a seemingly simple project can be very difficult to implement.

## Installation

- Download MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. 
Follow the instructions and install MongoDB on your computer.
- Clone the project from GitHub.
- Open in IntelliJ or your preferred IDE.
- Run the project.
- Follow the instructions in the console to use the application.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
